## Welcome to the SSRF Labs Chapter!

In this crucial segment of the course, we will immerse ourselves in the practical aspects of web application security with a focus on Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. Through our carefully curated lab environment, you will investigate and comprehend various cases of SSRF vulnerabilities and their significant impact on an organization's security.

SSRF is a grave security risk, as it can lead to unauthorized access to internal systems and sensitive data, enabling attackers to circumvent established security protocols. As a student of this course, you will have access to a variety of exercises and real-world scenarios that will aid in understanding the basics of identifying, analyzing, and ultimately mitigating these threats.

Throughout the lab exercises, you will gain practical skills in detecting SSRF vulnerabilities, understanding different attack techniques, and learning how to establish strong security measures to prevent unauthorized internal network access. Additionally, you will acquire insight into best practices and industry standards for managing and preventing SSRF attacks, a must-have knowledge for any aspiring security professional.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a robust understanding of the risks associated with SSRF attacks, their potential repercussions, and the necessary steps to effectively secure your organization's data and internal systems. So, get ready to plunge into the world of hands-on security focusing on SSRF!

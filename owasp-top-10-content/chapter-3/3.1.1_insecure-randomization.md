# Insecure Randomness in Web Applications

Insecure randomness refers to the use of weak or predictable random number generators (RNGs) in applications, particularly web applications, where a higher degree of unpredictability is required for ensuring data confidentiality and system security. Random numbers are widely employed in various aspects of web applications, including cryptographic functions, session identifiers, password generation, and token creation. When these random values are not generated securely, they become susceptible to attacks, leading to significant security risks.

The problem arises when web applications use pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) that are deterministic in nature, meaning they produce a predictable sequence of numbers based on a given seed value. Attackers can exploit this predictability to compromise the security of a system, as they can potentially determine the seed or the sequence of random numbers.

## Security Issues

Insecure randomness can lead to various security issues, such as:

1. **Session Hijacking**: Predictable session identifiers can allow attackers to hijack a user's session, gain unauthorized access to their accounts, and perform malicious actions.
2. **Brute Force Attacks**: Weakly generated passwords, tokens, or cryptographic keys can be more easily cracked by brute force, providing attackers with unauthorized access to sensitive data.
3. **Token Prediction**: Predictable tokens can lead to vulnerabilities in authentication, authorization, and anti-CSRF mechanisms, which can be exploited by attackers to manipulate or bypass security measures.

# Introduction to Insecure Design and Threat Modeling

Insecure design is a common problem in web applications that can lead to serious security risks. This is often due to developers not fully understanding the potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors associated with the technologies they're using. In this article, we'll introduce the concepts of insecure design and threat modeling as a way to counteract these issues.

## OWASP top 10 description

Insecure design is a broad category representing different weaknesses, expressed as “missing or ineffective control design.” Insecure design is not the source for all other Top 10 risk categories. There is a difference between insecure design and insecure implementation. We differentiate between design flaws and implementation defects for a reason, they have different root causes and remediation. A secure design can still have implementation defects leading to vulnerabilities that may be exploited. An insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were never created to defend against specific attacks. One of the factors that contribute to insecure design is the lack of business risk profiling inherent in the software or system being developed, and thus the failure to determine what level of security design is required.

## Insecure Design in Web Applications

Insecure design refers to the implementation of web applications in a manner that exposes them to potential attacks and vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actors to steal sensitive information, disrupt services, or gain unauthorized access to systems. Common examples of insecure design in web applications include:

- Insufficient input validation
- Insecure data storage
- Weak authentication and session management
- Insecure communication
- Misconfigured security settings

## Threat Modeling to Counter Insecure Design

Threat modeling is a proactive approach to identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities in a web application's design. By creating a detailed model of the application, developers can systematically evaluate potential attack vectors and prioritize mitigations. The threat modeling process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Identify assets**: Determine what sensitive data or critical functionality your application needs to protect.
2. **Create a system model**: Document your application's architecture, components, and data flows.
3. **Identify potential threats**: Analyze the system model to identify possible attack vectors and vulnerabilities.
4. **Determine risk**: Assess the likelihood and impact of each identified threat.
5. **Develop mitigations**: Design and implement security measures to address the highest-priority threats.

By incorporating threat modeling into the development process, teams can identify and address insecure design issues early, reducing the risk of security breaches and improving the overall security posture of their web applications.

## The four question framework for Threatmodeling

The Four Question Framework is a simple and effective approach to threat modeling, which helps teams identify potential security issues in a system. By answering four key questions, developers can gain a better understanding of the risks associated with their applications and prioritize the necessary security measures. The four questions in this framework are:

1. **What are we building?** The first step in threat modeling is to understand the system or application being developed. This involves creating a comprehensive representation of the system, such as data flow diagrams, architecture diagrams, or component lists. This documentation should clearly show how data flows through the application, the various components or services involved, and any trust boundaries or security controls in place.

2. **What can go wrong?** Once you have a clear understanding of the system, you need to identify the potential threats and vulnerabilities. This involves brainstorming or using structured methods, such as STRIDE, to systematically identify possible security issues. Consider potential attackers, their motivations, and the resources they might have. Also, think about common security risks, such as injection attacks, broken authentication, or sensitive data exposure.

3. **What are we going to do about it?** After identifying the threats, the next step is to prioritize and address them. This involves assessing the risk associated with each threat, considering factors like the likelihood of exploitation, potential impact, and the cost of implementing countermeasures. Develop mitigations for high-priority threats, such as implementing secure coding practices, adding encryption, or strengthening access controls.

4. **Did we do a good job?** Finally, it's essential to validate and verify that the implemented security measures are effective. This can be done through various methods, such as code reviews, penetration testing, or automated security scans. It's also important to continually reassess the threat model as the application evolves or as new threats emerge, to ensure that the security posture remains strong.

The Four Question Framework provides a straightforward and practical approach to threat modeling, allowing teams to identify and address potential security risks early in the development process. By regularly asking and answering these questions, you can improve your application's overall security and reduce the likelihood of successful attacks.

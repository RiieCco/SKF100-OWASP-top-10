# Welcome to the Insecure design labs chapter!

Welcome to the "Insecure Design" lab environment. In this interactive and hands-on lab, you will learn how to uncover security flaws in software systems by analyzing the provided models, UML diagrams, and flowcharts.

Our primary goal is to create a requirements traceability matrix, where you will map each feature and its corresponding use cases against the potential abuse cases per use case. This exercise will help you identify vulnerabilities and better understand the risks associated with each feature.

Once you've defined the possible abuse cases, you will have the exciting opportunity to exploit the application in our lab environment. This hands-on experience will allow you to test your assumptions and see how many of the abuse cases you've identified can be verified.

By the end of this lab, you will have gained valuable insights into the world of software security and will have sharpened your skills in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in real-life applications. Let's dive in and start exploring the fascinating world of insecure designs!

### RTM

A requirements traceability matrix (RTM) is a document that helps in tracking and tracing the requirements of a system throughout its development lifecycle. It establishes a clear link between the system's requirements, their origins, and the resulting design and implementation components. This helps ensure that each requirement is addressed and validated, while also providing a way to manage changes in requirements over time.

An RTM typically consists of a table or matrix with rows representing the requirements, and columns representing various stages of the development lifecycle, such as design, implementation, testing, and validation.

Let's consider a simplified example of a requirements traceability matrix for a basic e-commerce application:

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description         | Design Component   | Test Case ID | Validation Method   | Abuse Case                                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| R1             | User registration                | UserRegComponent   | TC1          | Functional Testing  | Unauthorized access to user registration data   |
| R2             | Login functionality              | LoginComponent     | TC2          | Functional Testing  | Brute force attacks, password cracking          |
| R3             | Product search                   | SearchComponent    | TC3          | Functional Testing  | SQL injection, data leakage                     |
| R4             | Shopping cart                    | CartComponent      | TC4          | Functional Testing  | Unauthorized access to shopping cart data       |
| R5             | Secure payment processing        | PaymentComponent   | TC5          | Security Testing    | Payment data theft, man-in-the-middle attacks  |


In this example, the Requirement ID column lists unique identifiers for each requirement, while the Requirement Description provides a brief overview of the requirement itself. The Design Component column specifies the components of the system responsible for addressing each requirement. The Test Case ID column references specific test cases designed to verify that the requirement has been implemented correctly. Lastly, the Validation Method column describes the type of testing or verification performed to validate the requirement.

An RTM can be especially useful in the context of security, as it helps identify potential vulnerabilities or abuse cases by examining the relationships between requirements, design components, and testing methods. By creating and maintaining an RTM throughout the development lifecycle, you can ensure a more secure and robust software system.

# Introduction to SQL Injection

SQL (Structured Query Language) Injection is a common web application vulnerability that occurs when malicious SQL code is inserted into an application's database query. This injection attack can allow an attacker to manipulate the application's database, gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the underlying server.

## How SQL Injection Can Be a Security Problem

SQL Injection poses a significant security risk to web applications as it takes advantage of poor input validation and inadequate handling of user-supplied data. Here's how it can be a security problem:

1. **Unauthorized Access**: By injecting SQL code, an attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to restricted data or functionality.

2. **Data Disclosure**: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, or other personally identifiable information.

3. **Data Manipulation**: SQL Injection allows attackers to modify, delete, or insert data into the database, altering the application's behavior or compromising data integrity.

4. **Remote Code Execution**: In severe cases, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying server, leading to a complete compromise of the system.

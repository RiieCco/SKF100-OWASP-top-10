# NoSQL injection

NoSQL injection is a type of cyber attack that targets web applications using NoSQL databases. NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases are a popular alternative to traditional relational databases for their scalability, flexibility, and ability to handle unstructured data. However, just like their SQL counterparts, they are susceptible to injection attacks if not properly secured.

NoSQL injection occurs when an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in a web application's data input validation, allowing them to manipulate, read, or delete data from the database without authorization. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, loss of data integrity, and other security issues.

A primary cause of NoSQL injection is improper handling of user input, which can result from insufficient input validation, inadequate output encoding, or insecure configuration of the database. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses by crafting malicious input, such as specially-formatted strings or JavaScript code, to manipulate database queries or directly interact with the database.

To mitigate the risk of NoSQL injection, developers should follow secure coding practices, such as:
- Validating and sanitizing user input
- Implementing proper output encoding
- Employing least-privilege access controls for database operations

Additionally, regular security testing and monitoring can help identify and address potential vulnerabilities in web applications using NoSQL databases.

# Introduction to OS Command Injection

OS command injection is a critical security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to execute arbitrary operating system commands on a target system, typically through a web application. This is possible when the application does not properly validate or sanitize user input before it is passed to system commands.

## Security Problems in Web Applications

Web applications are increasingly becoming the target of various cyber-attacks. One such attack is the OS command injection, which poses a significant security risk. The main issues that lead to this vulnerability include:

1. **Lack of input validation and sanitization**: When user input is not thoroughly checked for malicious code or characters, it may contain commands that can be executed by the underlying operating system.
2. **Insecure coding practices**: Developers may inadvertently use functions that allow for direct execution of commands without proper validation or escape mechanisms in place.
3. **Insufficient access controls**: In some cases, web applications may run with higher privileges than necessary, which can make it easier for an attacker to execute system commands.

When an attacker successfully exploits an OS command injection vulnerability, they can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify system files, or even take complete control of the target system. This can lead to a wide range of negative consequences, including data breaches, service disruptions, and reputational damage.

To mitigate the risks associated with OS command injection, developers must adhere to secure coding practices, implement strict input validation and sanitization, and ensure that applications run with the least privileges necessary.

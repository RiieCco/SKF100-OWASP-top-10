# Introduction to Rogue Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Untrusted Data Sources

## Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are a key part of modern web infrastructure, designed to efficiently deliver web content to users. A CDN's main function is to serve content to users with high availability and high performance.

However, when misused, CDNs can pose significant security risks. Rogue CDNs, or malicious CDNs, are one such misuse. These rogue CDNs can serve harmful content, either by hosting malicious files directly or by serving as a conduit for malware, thus putting users at risk.

## Untrusted Data Sources

Loading data from untrusted sources, such as JavaScript (JS) files, is a common practice in web development. It's convenient because it allows developers to leverage external libraries and resources.

However, this convenience comes with a significant security risk. If the external source is compromised, the attacker can serve malicious JS files instead of the legitimate ones. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data theft, and defacement of web pages.

## Potential Security Problems

Given their potential to serve malicious content, both rogue CDNs and untrusted data sources can be significant security problems.

### 1. Data Integrity

Rogue CDNs or compromised data sources can alter the data being sent to users. This could include injecting malicious scripts into legitimate web pages or altering the functionality of web applications.

### 2. Privacy

Malicious CDNs or data sources could collect sensitive user information without consent. For example, they could track user behavior, collect form data, or even steal login credentials.

### 3. Availability

A rogue CDN could deny service to intended users or serve them slow or inaccurate content. This can be particularly damaging for businesses that rely heavily on their online presence.

Therefore, it is crucial to only use trusted CDNs and data sources when building web applications. Also, using security measures such as Subresource Integrity (SRI) can help protect against some of these risks.

1. **What is the main function of a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?**
   - a) To scan for malware in network traffic
   - b) To serve content to users with high availability and high performance
   - c) To filter out harmful URLs from a site's backlink profile
   - d) To ensure that a site ranks highly in search engine results

2. **What can a rogue CDN potentially do?**
   - a) Improve the speed of your site
   - b) Serve harmful content to users
   - c) Increase the ranking of your site on search engines
   - d) None of the above

3. **What risk does loading data from untrusted sources such as JavaScript files pose?**
   - a) It increases the load time of your site
   - b) It decreases the availability of your site
   - c) It can lead to attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data theft, and defacement of web pages
   - d) It helps in the optimization of your site

4. **What can malicious CDNs or data sources potentially collect?**
   - a) User behavior, form data, and login credentials
   - b) The number of active users on a site
   - c) The IP addresses of site visitors
   - d) The number of pages on a site

5. **How can a rogue CDN affect the availability of a web service?**
   - a) By denying service to intended users or serving them slow or inaccurate content
   - b) By overloading the servers with requests
   - c) By injecting malware into the servers
   - d) By reducing the number of users accessing the web service

6. **What security measure can help protect against the risks of rogue CDNs and untrusted data sources?**
   - a) Subresource Integrity (SRI)

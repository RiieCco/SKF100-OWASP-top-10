# Brute Forcing Credentials and Web Application Security

## Introduction to Brute Forcing

Brute force attacks are a simple but dangerous security threat to web applications. In the simplest terms, a brute force attack involves an attacker trying multiple combinations of usernames and passwords until they find one that works.

## How Brute Forcing Works

1. **Guessing**: The attacker starts by guessing the credentials. They usually start with the most common passwords.

2. **Automated Input**: Tools are used to input different combinations automatically at high speed.

3. **Hit and Trial**: The attacker keeps trying until they succeed or decide to quit.

## Brute Forcing and Web Application Security

Brute force attacks pose a serious security risk to web applications. Even though they are simple, they can be highly effective if not appropriately mitigated.

1. **Credential Exposure**: If a brute force attack is successful, the attacker gains access to the user's account.

2. **Data Breach**: Once inside, the attacker can steal sensitive data or misuse the account.

3. **Service Disruption**: Repeated attempts to login can overwhelm the system resources, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS).

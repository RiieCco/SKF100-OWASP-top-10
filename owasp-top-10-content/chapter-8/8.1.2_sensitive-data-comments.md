# Sensitive data in comments.

The protection of sensitive data is of paramount importance when it comes to web application security. While developers often focus on secure coding practices and securing databases, one area that can sometimes be overlooked is the sensitive data that may be inadvertently exposed in code comments.

In both client-side and server-side code, comments are often used by developers to explain complex coding structures, note areas for future improvement, or even provide debugging details. While this can improve collaboration and understanding amongst a development team, it can also provide an unintended goldmine of information for malicious actors. For instance, comments may point out vulnerabilities, reveal important details about the system architecture, or even contain hard-coded credentials intended for testing.

Such exposure can give attackers a deeper understanding of the application's workings and potential weak points. They might use this knowledge to craft more targeted, effective attacks. Therefore, it is essential to audit and clean code comments regularly, ensuring they don't provide any unintentional assistance to those with malicious intent. By emphasizing this to your students, you are encouraging them to develop a well-rounded, comprehensive view of web application security.

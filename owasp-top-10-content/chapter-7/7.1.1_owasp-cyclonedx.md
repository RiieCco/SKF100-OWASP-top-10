## Introduction to CycloneDX

[CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) is a lightweight software bill of materials (SBOM) specification that is easily created, diffed, tracked, and can be used for component, application, container, and system-level management.

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a comprehensive inventory of every item that's needed to build your application. It lists all of the components, libraries, modules, and other resources, along with the relevant version numbers and other useful metadata.

### How to Use CycloneDX:

1. **Install CycloneDX:** CycloneDX supports a wide range of languages and package managers, including Java (Maven and Gradle), .NET (NuGet), Node.js (npm), Python (pip), Ruby (Gems), and PHP (Composer), among others. Each ecosystem has its own tool, so you'll need to install the one that matches your project.

2. **Generate SBOM:** Once you have the tool installed, you can use it to generate an SBOM for your project. This typically involves running a command in your project's directory. The command and options will vary depending on your ecosystem, but it generally looks something like this: `cyclonedx-bom -o ./bom.xml`.

3. **Analyze SBOM:** After the SBOM has been generated, you can use it to analyze your project's dependencies. This could involve looking for outdated components, checking for known vulnerabilities, or simply getting a better understanding of what your software is made of.

4. **Update and Track:** The SBOM isn't a static document. Every time you update your software, you should also update your SBOM.

CycloneDX is widely adopted due to its cross-ecosystem support. Regardless of which package manager or language you're using, there's a good chance that CycloneDX supports it.

# Introduction to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) is a common security vulnerability that occurs when an application exposes direct access to internal objects, such as files, database records, or other system resources, without proper access control. This can lead to unauthorized users being able to access, modify, or delete sensitive data, potentially causing severe consequences for the system and its users.

IDOR vulnerabilities typically arise when developers implement insufficient or improper access controls on resources that are referenced by URL parameters, form fields, or other user-controlled inputs. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by manipulating these inputs to gain unauthorized access to resources that they should not be able to access.

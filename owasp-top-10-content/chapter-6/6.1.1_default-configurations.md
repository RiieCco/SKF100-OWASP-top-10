# Introduction to Default Configuration Settings

_Default configuration settings_ are the initial settings that come with software or systems, such as web servers or content management systems, that are used for deploying web applications. These settings are designed to provide a functional starting point, making it easier for users to quickly set up and configure their applications. However, relying on these default settings can introduce **security vulnerabilities** that can be exploited by malicious users.

## Security Problems in Web Applications

The use of default configuration settings can lead to a variety of security issues in web applications:

1. **Predictable Credentials**: Default settings often include default usernames and passwords, which are well-known and can be easily guessed by attackers.
2. **Unnecessary Features**: Some default configurations enable features or services that may not be needed for a specific application, potentially exposing additional attack surfaces.
3. **Lack of Security Hardening**: Default settings may not be optimized for security, resulting in weaker encryption algorithms, insecure protocols, or outdated software versions.

To mitigate these risks, it is essential to review and customize the default configuration settings before deploying a web application. This includes changing default credentials, disabling unnecessary features, and applying security best practices to ensure a robust and secure web application environment.

## Security Risks of Default Configuration Settings

It's important to understand that default configuration settings can introduce significant security risks for applications. Let's take a look at two examples: MongoDB and Elasticsearch.

### MongoDB

In older versions of MongoDB, the default configuration did not enable authentication by default. This means that anyone with network access to the database could potentially access and manipulate the data without providing any form of authentication. This lack of authentication posed a serious security risk, as it allowed unauthorized individuals to gain unrestricted access to sensitive information.

Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to view, modify, or delete data, potentially leading to data breaches and compromised systems. It also allowed for the possibility of unauthorized privilege escalation, where attackers could gain administrative access and take control of the entire database.

### Elasticsearch

Similarly, older versions of Elasticsearch also had a default configuration that did not enable authentication by default. This meant that anyone who had network access to the Elasticsearch cluster could perform various actions, including reading, modifying, or deleting data, without providing any credentials.

Without authentication, Elasticsearch clusters were exposed to potential unauthorized access and manipulation, posing a significant security risk. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to tamper with data, perform unauthorized searches, or even delete critical indices.

#### Attacks

In the wild, these misconfigurations were often exploited by attackers leveraging services like Shodan. Shodan is a popular search engine for Internet-connected devices that allows users to discover publicly accessible systems and services. Attackers would utilize Shodan to identify exposed instances of MongoDB or Elasticsearch with default or insecure configurations. They could then target these vulnerable systems, gaining unauthorized access and potentially wreaking havoc by exfiltrating sensitive data, modifying databases, or even deploying ransomware. The widespread availability of such misconfigured systems on the Internet served as an open invitation for attackers, highlighting the critical importance of properly configuring and securing these services to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

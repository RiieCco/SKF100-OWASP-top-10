# Introduction to Default Configuration Settings

_Default configuration settings_ are the initial settings that come with software or systems, such as web servers or content management systems, that are used for deploying web applications. These settings are designed to provide a functional starting point, making it easier for users to quickly set up and configure their applications. However, relying on these default settings can introduce **security vulnerabilities** that can be exploited by malicious users.

## Security Problems in Web Applications

The use of default configuration settings can lead to a variety of security issues in web applications:

1. **Predictable Credentials**: Default settings often include default usernames and passwords, which are well-known and can be easily guessed by attackers.
2. **Unnecessary Features**: Some default configurations enable features or services that may not be needed for a specific application, potentially exposing additional attack surfaces.
3. **Lack of Security Hardening**: Default settings may not be optimized for security, resulting in weaker encryption algorithms, insecure protocols, or outdated software versions.

To mitigate these risks, it is essential to review and customize the default configuration settings before deploying a web application. This includes changing default credentials, disabling unnecessary features, and applying security best practices to ensure a robust and secure web application environment.
